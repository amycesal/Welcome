# DVS Moderators Guide

Welcome and thanks for volunteering to be a moderator for the Data Visualization Society! We really appreciate your help in making our community a warm, welcoming and inclusive place to hang out.

Being a moderator largely means keeping an eye on the channel youâ€™re responsible for and making sure people follow the [DVS code of conduct](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/code-of-conduct). Take a moment to go read it so itâ€™s fresh in mind your mind. Donâ€™t worry, weâ€™ll wait.

Being a moderator adds a couple of other additional **responsibilities**:

- **Keep discussions focused and on-topic**. This can mean asking people thread a conversation so itâ€™s easier to follow, or asking people to consider moving their chat to another channel if it would be more suited there.
- **Keep it professional**. DVS is a professional organisation, so be professional when speaking in an official capacity. Oh, and be doubly careful that you donâ€™t breach the code of conduct yourself - that would be kinda awkward. ðŸ˜¬
- **Assume good faith**. We donâ€™t have much of a troll problem, so someone breaking the rules is likely doing so because they donâ€™t know any better, not because theyâ€™re trying to disrupt the community. Be patient and forgiving. Explain what the rules are and give them a chance to correct their mistake.
- **Be transparent**. If you need to take action like deleting messages or booting someone out of a channel, write a quick note to the affected parties explaining what youâ€™re doing and why youâ€™re doing it. Itâ€™s only fair.
- **Ask for help if you need it**. Being a moderator on the internet in 2019 is a thankless task. Itâ€™s okay to get overwhelmed, or to question your instincts on a decision. You can always dip into #dvs-moderators and ask for a second opinion if a case is borderline - weâ€™ve got your back. If you need to take a break, temporarily or permanently, from moderating, then please tell us about it so we can get someone to cover for you. Donâ€™t just ghost us. ðŸ‘»


Finally, if you have any questions then donâ€™t hesitate to ask one of the [DVS facilitators](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/the-team) over a Slack message and theyâ€™ll help you out. Weâ€™re all in this together! ðŸ˜Š
